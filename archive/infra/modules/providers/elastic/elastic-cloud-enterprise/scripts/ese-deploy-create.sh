# This script orchestrates the following actions, ultimately resulting in
# an Elasticsearch cluster being provisioned through ECE.
# 
# Steps:
#   - Verify that `jq` is installed
#   - Invoke a Create Deployment API request. This is an asynchronous operation.
#   - Poll deployment API until the cluster is healthy, or a timeout is exceeded.
#   - Query the Elasticsearch instance to retrieve its endpoint.
#
# Because this script is executed within the context of a Terraform local exec provisioner
# (docs: https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html) it is important to
# note the following:
#   - All output to stdout is captured as the "response" of the command, and it is assumed
#     to be in the form of a map<string, string>.
#   - In order to provide context that is readable from terraform, all "logging" output
#     is done to stderr.
#
# Note: Each `curl` command is passed the `--insecure` flag to deal with the improperly
# configured certificates provisioned as part of the ECE installation. When this is
# resolved, we can remove the flag.
#

# Check if `jq` is installed. If not, fail fast.

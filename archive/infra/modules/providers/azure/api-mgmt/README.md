## api-mgmt

The API Management cobalt module allows terraform templates to configure and provision an Azure API Management service and the critical resources found in most instances. API Management provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. Azure API Management can be used to take any backend and launch a full-fledged API program based on it. Package and publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers securely and at scale using the fully managed platform to manage and deploy the required infrastructure.

More information on Azure API Management can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/).

## Characteristics

Cobalt provides the ability to provision an API Management service along with the following characteristics:

- Provisions a single API Management service into the specified resource group with control over sku, publisher info, policies, and tags
- Supports creation of apis through specification files with full versioning capabilities
- Supports creation of groups
- Supports creation of products and allows for association with apis and groups
- Supports creation of backends
- Supports creation of named values
- Supports policies for services, apis, products, and operations
- Supports tags for services, apis, products, and named values

## Usage

Example that includes all possible service, api, version set, product, group, backend, named value, policy, and tag values:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "cobalt-rg"
  location = "East US"
}

locals {
  basic_policy      = <<XML
<policies>
    <inbound />
    <backend />
    <outbound />
    <on-error />
</policies>
XML
  rate_limit_policy = <<XML
<policies>
    <inbound>
    <rate-limit-by-key calls="10" renewal-period="120" counter-key="@(context.Request.IpAddress)"/>
        <base />
    </inbound>
    <backend />
    <outbound />
    <on-error />
</policies>
XML

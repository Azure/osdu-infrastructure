# keyvault

A terraform module to provide key vaults in Azure with the following characteristics:

- Generates or updates a target key vault resource in azure: `keyvault_name`.
- The key vault is created in a specified resource group: `resource_group_name`.

- Key Vault SKU is configurable: `keyvault_sku`. Defaults to `standard`.
- Access policy permissions for the deployment's service principal are configurable: `keyvault_key_permissions`, `keyvault_secret_permissions` and `keyvault_certificate_permissions`.
- Specified resource tags are updated to the targeted vault: `resource_tags`.

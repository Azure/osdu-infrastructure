## Set up GitOps Repository for Flux

Flux watches a Git repository containing the resource manifests that should be deployed into the Kubernetes cluster, and, as such, we need to configure that repo and give Flux permissions to access it at cluster creation time.

1. Create a repo to use for GitOps. This example will assume that you are using one of the public git repo such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab, or BitBucket, but flux supports private git repos with [additional configuration](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/master/site/faq.md#how-do-i-use-a-private-git-host-or-one-thats-not-githubcom-gitlabcom-bitbucketorg-or-devazurecom).
2. Create/choose a SSH key pair that will be given permission to do read/write access to the repository. You can create an ssh key pair with the Bash `ssh-keygen` command as shown in the code block below.
3. Add the SSH public key to the repository. Flux requires read and write access to the resource manifest git repository. For GitHub, the process to add a deploy key is documented [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/). For Azure DevOps repos, the process is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops).
4. Have your CI/CD pipeline run at least once and commit an initial set of resource manifests to your repo.  Flux requires at least one commit in your resource manifest repo to operate correctly.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f gitops_repo_key

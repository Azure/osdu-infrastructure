# traffic-manager

A terraform module to manage a traffic manager instance and it's endpoints in Azure with the following characteristics:

- Ability to create or update a traffic manager profile. Traffic routing method is set to `Weighted`.
- The profile is created in the specified resource group `resource_group_name`.
- The DNS name on the profile is configured: `traffic_manager_dns_name`.
- The monitoring protocol and port are specified through `traffic_manager_monitor_protocol` and `traffic_manager_monitor_port`. Defaults to https and 443.
- Specified resource tags are updated to the targeted vault: `resource_tags`.
- One traffic manager endpoint is created along with a dynamic Public IP address. The endpoint is bounded to the traffic manager profile. The weighting of the endpoint is set to `1`.
- The DNS name is configured via `public_ip_name`.

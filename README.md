# osdu-infrastructure


[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Azure/osdu-infrastructure)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Azure/osdu-infrastructure)

This project is an implementation of the Infrastructure as Code and Pipelines necessary to build and deploy the required infrastructure necessary for the [Open Subsurface Data Universe](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu) (OSDU). Links and additional information is located in [GitLab](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/deployment-and-operations/infrastructure-templates) for OSDU discoverability.


Patterns used leverage Microsoft Projects, for detailed design principals, operation and tutorials on these patterns it is best to review information directly from those projects. 

1. [Project Cobalt](https://github.com/microsoft/cobalt)
2. [Project Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock)

Please be aware that branching strategies are aligned with OSDU and the master branch is intended to be used as a [Current Delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery) mechanism that aligns with master branches for the [OSDU Platform]((https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform))

## Architecture Solutions
This project is an active project and the master branch is constantly changing to support OSDU features. Rhe master branch is intended to be in sync with the master branches of the OSDU Service branches.

This project holds 2 different Solution Architectures for OSDU on Azure.

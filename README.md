# osdu-infrastructure

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)

This project is an implementation of the Infrastructure as Code and Pipelines necessary to build and deploy the required infrastructure necessary for the [Open Subsurface Data Universe](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu) (OSDU).  Project Development for this code base is performed and maintained on osdu-infrastructure in [GitHub](http://github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure) with a mirrored copy located in [GitLab](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/deployment-and-operations/infrastructure-templates).

All patterns for this have been built and leverage to Microsoft Projects, for detailed design principals, operation and tutorials and those patterns it is best to review information directly from those projects.

# osdu-infrastructure


[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Azure/osdu-infrastructure)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Azure/osdu-infrastructure)

This project is an implementation of the Infrastructure as Code and Pipelines necessary to build and deploy the required infrastructure necessary for the [Open Subsurface Data Universe](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu) (OSDU). Links and additional information is located in [GitLab](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/deployment-and-operations/infrastructure-templates) for OSDU discoverability.


Patterns used here derived from concepts in other Microsoft Projects, for detailed design principals, operation and tutorials on some of these patterns it is best to review information directly from those projects. 

1. [Project Cobalt](https://github.com/microsoft/cobalt)
2. [Project Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock)

Please be aware that branching strategies are aligned with OSDU and the master branch is intended to be used as a [Current Delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery) mechanism that aligns with master branches for the [OSDU Platform]((https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform))

This project is an active project and the master branch changes frequently to support OSDU features.  The intent is for Master to be in sync with OSDU Service master branches.

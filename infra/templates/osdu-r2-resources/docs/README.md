# Deploying App Service Collection with Elastic Cloud Full Text PaaS Search Solution

v0.1 - 12/4/2019

## Introduction

Some of Cobalt’s enterprise customers have a small number of microservices they'd like to deploy and host with Azure managed PaaS app services. Geospatial documents are indexed in Elastic Search to accomodate bounding box and radius distance querying scenarios. This template provisions an instance of an fully managed PaaS Elasticsearch hosted in [EC](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/).

This document outlines how Cobalt can be extended to meet the use cases of these customers. The intended audience of this document is the development and product teams working on Cobalt and related projects.

## In Scope

- Identify deployment topology needed by the customer
- Identify key Terraform templates needed for deployment
- Identify key Terraform modules needed for deployment
- Identify gaps in Terraform provider templates

## Out of scope

- External customer sign-off
- Template (Terraform, ARM) implementation
- VNET Integration
- Service Containerization
- How existing storage services like Elastic Cloud and Cosmos can be imported to reduce azure subscription incurred costs

## Key Terms
- **RG**: Abbreviation for “Resource Group”
- **Sub**: Abbreviation for “Subscription”
- **Persona**: An archetype of a Cobalt customer
- **Stage**: An application deployment stage (dev, qa, pre-prod, prod, etc...)
- **Region**: A location in which an application is deployed



## Customers
- **Admin**: This persona represents an administrator of Azure. This persona does not implement the line of business applications but will help other teams deliver them.
- **App Developer Team**: This persona is responsible for creating and maintaining the line of business applications

## Open Questions

These open questions may impact the implementation plan and overall scope of the deployment described below

- What are the azure monitoring rules for this template?
- How can we shard a single instance of APIM so that it can be shared by many azure environments?
- How can we shard a single instance of Elastic Seach so that it can be shared by many azure environments?

## Deployment Topology

This graphic shows the targeted deployment topology needed by our enterprise customers. The deployment is deployed to a single tenant and subscription. The resources are partitioned to align with the different personas within the customer.

## Template Topology

The graphic below outlines the topology of the terraform templates that will deploy the topology called out above.

### Credential Management

Managed Identities (MI, or MSI) will be used to manage access to credentials when possible. This table identifies MSI support for each resource leveraged by the template (full compatability breakdown [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities)):

| Azure Service | Supports MSI | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| App Service | Yes | N/A |
| Key Vault | Yes | N/A |
| Azure Functions | Yes | N/A |
| Blob Storage | Yes | N/A |
| REDIS | No | Credentials stored in Key Vault |
| Cosmos | No | Credentials stored in Key Vault |
| Service Bus | Yes | N/A |
| Elastic | No | Credentials stored in Key Vault |

### Risks

- Ingress / Egress for app services, functions and storage endpoints are not restricted to virtual network(s) by default. In summary, by default these services are exposed to the public internet.
  - Mitigation strategy: App Service VNET access restriction can be enabled by setting the `vnet_subnet_id` setting. We still need to support VNET restrictions for the functions module.

## Security

Here is an overview of the security for the deployment strategy and templates discussed above:

- **Role Assignments**: The service principal running the deployment will have to be an owner in the target subscription and granted admin consent to the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` role in Microsoft Graph. This template creates a new service principal that will be available for application developer team(s) to administer the provisioned Azure resources. The following role assignments will be made to that service principal:
  - Contributor access to App Service & App Insights in the first Resource Group
  - Contributor access to the second and third Resource Groups. *If needed, we can lock this down further by granting role access to individual resources in this RG.*
- **Service to Service communication**: For services owned by the application development team persona we will leverage Managed Service Identity (MSI) for authenticating to cloud services wherever possible. Where this is not possible, MSI will be used to pull credentials from Key Vault. This connection is done via MSI and therefore it keeps all secrets out of the codebase. This limits the attack vector of the infrastructure.

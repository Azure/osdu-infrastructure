# Azure Small Microservice Mesh on Elastic Cloud Enterprise - Image Registry Environment

The `az-micro-svc-small-elastic-cloud` - `image_registry` environment template is intended to provision Azure the Azure Container Registry resource. We decided to split these configuration files out into a separate Terraform module to 1) mitigate the risk of Terraform accidentally deleting stateful resources types and 2) This ACR resource is referenced across all Azure environment resources provisioned through the `container_cluster` and `managed_service` environments.

## Technical Design
Template design [specifications](../../docs/design/README.md).

## Architecture
![Template Topology](../../docs/images/topology.png "Template Topology")

## Intended audience

Cloud administrators that's versed with Cobalt templating.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure Subscription
2. An available Service Principal with API Permissions granted with Admin Consent within Azure app registration. The required Azure Active Directory Graph app role is `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy`

3. Terraform and Go are locally installed
4. Azure Storage Account is [setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/terraform/terraform-backend) to store Terraform state
5. Local environment variables are [setup](https://github.com/microsoft/cobalt/blob/f31aff95e7732efde96c91b2779e94e16c1d538e/docs/2_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md#step-3-setup-local-environment-variables)
6. Deployment Service Principal is granted Owner level role assignment for the target Azure subscription

## Cost

Azure environment cost ballpark [estimate](https://azure.com/e/92b05a7cd1e646368ab74772e3122500). This is subject to change and is driven from the resource pricing tiers configured when the template is deployed. 

## Deployment Steps

1. Execute the following commands to set up your local environment variables:

*Note for Windows Users using WSL*: We recommend running dos2unix utility on the environment file via `dos2unix .env` prior to sourcing your environment variables to chop trailing newline and carriage return characters.

```bash
# these commands setup all the environment variables needed to run this template
DOT_ENV=<path to your .env file>
export $(cat $DOT_ENV | xargs)
```

2. Execute the following command to configure your local Azure CLI.

```bash
# This logs your local Azure CLI in using the configured service principal.
az login --service-principal -u $ARM_CLIENT_ID -p $ARM_CLIENT_SECRET --tenant $ARM_TENANT_ID
```

3. Navigate to the `terraform.tfvars` terraform file. Here's a sample of the terraform.tfvars file for this template.

```HCL
resource_group_name     = "osdu-r2-acr"
resource_group_location = "centralus"
container_registry_name = "osducr"
```

4. Execute the following commands to set up your terraform workspace.

```bash
# This configures terraform to leverage a remote backend that will help you and your
# team keep consistent state
terraform init -backend-config "storage_account_name=${TF_VAR_remote_state_account}" -backend-config "container_name=${TF_VAR_remote_state_container}"

# This command configures terraform to use a workspace unique to you. This allows you to work
# without stepping over your teammate's deployments
TF_WORKSPACE="dev-int-env"
terraform workspace new $TF_WORKSPACE || terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
```

5. Execute the following commands to orchestrate a deployment.

```bash
# See what terraform will try to deploy without actually deploying
terraform plan

# Execute a deployment
terraform apply
```

6. Optionally execute the following command to teardown your deployment and delete your resources.

```bash
# Destroy resources and tear down deployment. Only do this if you want to destroy your deployment.
terraform destroy
```
